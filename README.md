Debugging tools for iOS

This was a project I did before all the view-inspection tools that we have today like Reveal, Spark Inspector, Xcode's new tools, etc.
I intended to productize it, but I never finished it. Anyways, I'm out of private repositories, so here it is in all of it's hacky glory. 

It takes advantage of the external screen support in the simulator (or on device with airplay or an hdmi adapter) to display view heirarchy, as well as which view controller owns said view, as well as displaying an enumeration of properties and ivars of the selected view and associate view controller. It was useful for me at some point. I think Reveal shows the relevant view controller now.

I don't intend to continue development on this. 2012 code pls don't judge
